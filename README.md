Overview

The aim of this project was to build a modern website that combines creativity, aesthetics, and cutting-edge web development practices. It leverages some of the latest technologies, including integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT (version 4.0). What began as a design project evolved into a mini full-stack application, featuring both a live frontend and backend.

Functionality

This website/application is designed to immediately capture attention by showcasing its AI capabilities. The user journey has been carefully planned to provide a smooth, engaging, and intuitive experience, guiding visitors from first impression to meaningful interaction.

Key features include:

Interactive AI: Users can interact with the AI, which generates dynamic responses in real time using OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4.0 model.

Travel Through Time Effect: On the homepage, users can trigger a “Travel Through Time” animation by clicking the Future Motion button, adding a dynamic and immersive element.

Calls to Action: Multiple calls to action are included, such as a prominent “Get Started” button that encourages immediate engagement.

Hidden Features & Hover Effects: Users can unlock hidden aesthetic elements. For example, hovering over mini cards reveals additional content, such as the About Me section, creating a more engaging experience.

Contact & Packages: Users can easily get in touch and choose from a variety of available packages, making the website both interactive and service-oriented.
