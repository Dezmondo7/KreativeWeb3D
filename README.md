## Real-Time Telemetry Pipeline & Secure AI Architecture

What began as an exploration into modern UI/UX design evolved into a sophisticated mini full-stack application. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of a live React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a cloud-based database (Supabase), complemented by a real-time monitoring dashboard and AI-driven user interaction.

## Functionality

AI Integration: Built a custom interface leveraging the OpenAI GPT-4.0 API. The system handles asynchronous user requests via a secure input field, returning low-latency, live responses from the model.

Real-Time Telemetry: Implemented custom React Hooks to capture granular user telemetry (X and Y coordinates). This data is mapped to specific DOM sections to analyze user behavior and interaction heatmaps.

Data Pipeline: Developed a pipeline where telemetry data is transmitted from the client-side to a web server and persisted in a Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.

Live Analytics Dashboard: Constructed a dedicated Next.js Dashboard that fetches and visualizes database events in real-time, providing an "at-a-glance" view of active user movement across the landing page.

## Key features include:

Dynamic AI Engine: Developed a real-time interaction layer using the OpenAI GPT-4 API. This implementation manages complex asynchronous states, ensuring that "streamed" responses are handled efficiently without blocking the main UI thread.

Time-Travel State Engine: Created a "Travel Through Time" immersive experience triggered via the Future Motion gateway. This utilizes advanced CSS animations and React state transitions to manipulate the DOM dynamically, providing a high-performance, cinematic user experience.

Engagement Architecture: Strategically implemented high-conversion Calls to Action (CTAs), including an interactive "Get Started" module designed to handle user intent and navigation flow.

Interactive Micro-services & UI Discovery: Designed a "hidden feature" system using hover-state logic. Mini-card components utilize conditional rendering and transition libraries to reveal expanded content (such as the 'About Me' section), demonstrating a sophisticated approach to information density and user engagement.

Service-Oriented Infrastructure: Built a modular "Contact & Packages" system, allowing for structured user inquiries. This section acts as the primary interface for user-to-server communication, demonstrating the ability to build functional, service-oriented web applications.ed.

## Tech Stack

The project was built using the following technologies:

Frontend Development: React (with Vite for fast builds), JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3

Styling & Layout: TailwindCSS for responsive design and modern UI components

Animations & Interactivity: GSAP Animation and Framer Motion for smooth, dynamic user experiences

Backend & Integrations: EmailJS for handling contact form submissions

AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4.0) for intelligent, real-time responses
